To design an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a system that manages User, Role, and Permission entities, we can create the following tables with their columns, data types, primary keys, and relationships:

1. User Table:
   - Attributes:
     - UserID (Primary Key)
     - Name
     - ContactNumber
     - EmailAddress

2. Role Table:
   - Attributes:
     - RoleID (Primary Key)
     - NameInArabic
     - NameInEnglish

3. Permission Table:
   - Attributes:
     - PermissionID (Primary Key)
     - Name
     - Description

4. User_Role (Many-to-Many Relationship Table):
   - Attributes:
     - User_Role_ID (Primary Key)
     - UserID (Foreign Key referencing User)
     - RoleID (Foreign Key referencing Role)

5. Role_Permission (Many-to-Many Relationship Table):
   - Attributes:
     - Role_Permission_ID (Primary Key)
     - RoleID (Foreign Key referencing Role)
     - PermissionID (Foreign Key referencing Permission)

The relationships between these tables are as follows:

- A User can have multiple Roles, and a Role can be assigned to multiple Users. This is a many-to-many relationship, and it is represented using the User_Role table.

- A Role can have multiple Permissions, and a Permission can be associated with multiple Roles. This is also a many-to-many relationship, and it is represented using the Role_Permission table.

Here are the primary keys and foreign keys:

- User Table: UserID (Primary Key)
- Role Table: RoleID (Primary Key)
- Permission Table: PermissionID (Primary Key)
- User_Role Table: User_Role_ID (Primary Key), UserID (Foreign Key), RoleID (Foreign Key)
- Role_Permission Table: Role_Permission_ID (Primary Key), RoleID (Foreign Key), PermissionID (Foreign Key)

The indexes should be created on the columns that appear the most in the Where clause

1-User Table:
	Consider adding an index to the UserID field.

2-Role Table:
	Consider adding an index to the RoleID field.

3-Permission Table:
	Consider adding an index to the PermissionID field.

4-User_Role Table:
	Consider adding an index to the UserID and RoleID fields.

5-Role_Permission Table:
	Consider adding an index to the RoleID and PermissionID fields.
